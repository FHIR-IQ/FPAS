# Risks - FHIR IQ Prior Authorization POC

## Technical Risks

### 1. X12 278 Mapping Complexity
**Risk**: Ambiguity in mapping FHIR resources to X12 278 format
**Impact**: May block production integration with legacy systems
**Mitigation**:
- Keep mapper modular at adapter edge
- Document mapping decisions clearly
- Engage X12 expert early if needed
- Consider licensing commercial mapper

### 2. Evolving PAS/DTR IG Versions
**Risk**: Breaking changes between IG STU versions
**Impact**: Rework required, compatibility issues
**Mitigation**:
- Pin IG canonical URLs per release
- Add version gates in CI
- Abstract IG-specific logic
- Monitor HL7 ballot cycles

### 3. CQL Execution Performance
**Risk**: Complex CQL expressions may timeout
**Impact**: Poor user experience, prepopulation failures
**Mitigation**:
- Start with simple expressions
- Add caching layer
- Set execution timeouts
- Profile and optimize queries

### 4. FHIR Server Limitations
**Risk**: OSS FHIR server may not support all needed features
**Impact**: Custom development required
**Mitigation**:
- Evaluate HAPI FHIR capabilities early
- Have fallback to commercial option
- Keep server abstracted
- Document limitations

## Integration Risks

### 5. Mock vs Real UM System Gap
**Risk**: Mock rules too simplistic for demo
**Impact**: POC doesn't demonstrate real value
**Mitigation**:
- Work with UM team on realistic rules
- Add configurable complexity
- Document production requirements
- Plan integration sprint post-POC

### 6. EHR Integration Assumptions
**Risk**: Assumed FHIR capabilities not available
**Impact**: Prepopulation doesn't work as expected
**Mitigation**:
- Use realistic mock data
- Document EHR requirements clearly
- Test with multiple FHIR servers
- Have manual fallback option

## Security/Compliance Risks

### 7. Simplified Security Model
**Risk**: POC security insufficient for production
**Impact**: Major rework for production deployment
**Mitigation**:
- Document production security requirements
- Use standard OAuth patterns
- Keep security modular
- Plan security sprint post-POC

### 8. PHI in Test Data
**Risk**: Accidental use of real patient data
**Impact**: HIPAA violation, legal exposure
**Mitigation**:
- Use synthetic data only
- Clear data handling policies
- Automated PHI detection
- Regular audit of test data

## Schedule Risks

### 9. Scope Creep
**Risk**: Stakeholders request additional features
**Impact**: POC timeline slips
**Mitigation**:
- Document POC boundaries clearly
- Regular stakeholder communication
- Change control process
- Phase 2 backlog for additions

### 10. Learning Curve
**Risk**: Team unfamiliar with FHIR/CQL/SMART
**Impact**: Slower development, quality issues
**Mitigation**:
- Training budget allocated
- Use experienced contractors
- Leverage vendor support
- Pair programming approach

## Operational Risks

### 11. Inferno Test Failures
**Risk**: POC fails conformance tests
**Impact**: Cannot claim compliance
**Mitigation**:
- Test early and often
- Understand test requirements
- Engage Inferno community
- Document known limitations

### 12. Performance Under Load
**Risk**: POC doesn't scale for demo
**Impact**: Failed stakeholder demo
**Mitigation**:
- Load test early
- Have scaling plan ready
- Set realistic expectations
- Use caching aggressively

## Business Risks

### 13. Stakeholder Alignment
**Risk**: Different visions of success
**Impact**: POC doesn't meet expectations
**Mitigation**:
- Clear success criteria upfront
- Regular demos and feedback
- Written acceptance criteria
- Stakeholder sign-off points

### 14. Production Path Unclear
**Risk**: POC doesn't lead to production system
**Impact**: Wasted investment
**Mitigation**:
- Document production roadmap
- Identify integration points
- Budget for production phase
- Clear go/no-go criteria

## Dependency Risks

### 15. Third-Party Service Availability
**Risk**: Dependency services unavailable
**Impact**: Development blocked
**Mitigation**:
- Local development environment
- Mock external services
- Vendor SLAs reviewed
- Backup options identified

## Risk Matrix (POC-Focused)

```
Impact â†’     Low         Medium        High
Probability
   High      [10]        [9,13]        [1]
   Medium    [15]        [5,6,11]      [2,3]
   Low       [8]         [7,12,14]     [4]
```

## Risk Response Plan

### Week 1-2 Decisions
- Finalize tech stack (Risk #10)
- Evaluate FHIR server options (Risk #4)
- Set scope boundaries (Risk #9)

### Continuous Monitoring
- IG version changes (Risk #2)
- Performance metrics (Risk #3, #12)
- Stakeholder feedback (Risk #13)

### Mitigation Budget
- Training: 20 hours
- External expertise: $10K contingency
- Additional cloud resources: $2K
- Total risk budget: ~$15K (10% of project)

## Success Factors

### Must Prevent
- Real PHI exposure
- Complete POC failure
- Stakeholder misalignment

### Can Accept
- Some Inferno test failures (documented)
- Limited performance (with plan to improve)
- Simplified security (with production plan)

### Early Warning Signs
- Missed sprint goals
- Increasing technical debt
- Stakeholder confusion
- Performance degradation
